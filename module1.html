        <h2>Content</h2>
        <h3>1. The Science of Emotions</h3>
        <p><strong>What Are Emotions?</strong> Emotions are complex psychological states that involve three components: subjective experience, physiological response, and behavioral expression. This section explores the connection between emotions and the brain, focusing on the limbic system and its role in emotional regulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Emotions Matter in Relationships:</strong> Emotions act as signals that guide human interaction. Understanding how emotions affect behavior can help strengthen your bond with Suyie.</p>

        <h3>2. Emotional Recognition Techniques</h3>
        <p><strong>Microexpressions:</strong> Learn to identify fleeting facial expressions that reveal genuine emotions, even when someone tries to hide them.</p>
        <p><strong>Body Language:</strong> Recognize how posture, gestures, and movement reflect emotional states. For example, crossed arms might signal discomfort or defensiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Vocal Cues:</strong> Analyze changes in tone, pitch, and speed of speech to detect underlying feelings.</p>

        <h3>3. Building Emotional Awareness</h3>
        <p><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> Reflect on your emotional responses during interactions with Suyie. Awareness of your emotions allows you to respond more thoughtfully.</p>
        <p><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Practice listening without interrupting or judging. Use paraphrasing to confirm your understanding of Suyie’s feelings.</p>
        <p><strong>Empathy Development:</strong> Put yourself in Suyie’s shoes to better appreciate her perspective and emotional experiences.</p>

        <h2>Practical Exercises</h2>
        <h3>Exercise 1: Emotional Journaling</h3>
        <p>Keep a daily journal for one week. Record observations of Suyie’s emotional states, noting the context, her expressions, and your responses. Reflect on patterns and opportunities for improvement.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 2: Active Listening Practice</h3>
        <p>Engage in a 10-minute conversation with Suyie. Focus solely on listening, avoiding interruptions or unsolicited advice. Afterward, write down what you learned about her emotional state and how she felt during the conversation.</p>

        <h3>Exercise 3: Empathy Role-Play</h3>
        <p>Role-play a scenario where Suyie shares a challenging experience. Practice responding empathetically by validating her emotions and asking open-ended questions.</p>
